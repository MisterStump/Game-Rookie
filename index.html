        <h2>In Early Development</h2>
        I am just starting to mess around with making this. It is meant to be helpful to me, but is also meant to be an exercise with HTML/CSS.
        <h2>What is Game Rookie?</h2>
        <p>The goal of this tool is to make it easy for someone with little experience with a tabletop RPG to be able to play the role of GM/DM without a lot of preperation. This means making it easy to quickly make encounters, find prices, generate magic items relevant to the part's level, and more.</p>
