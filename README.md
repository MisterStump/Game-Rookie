# Under Development
This project is just a fun exercise for me, and is heavily under development. Features will not work, be missing, or just look terrible. I'd keep this private, but I wanted to expose the GitHub Pages so here we are together. If you have any suggestions or feedback I am always open to constructive criticism.

# Overview
Game Rookie is a GM/DM assisting tool for a popular Tabletop RPG.

The main issue I was experiencing as a GM was that I wanted to do basically 0 prep work, but still be able to pull together interesting encounters quickly. I basically needed a convenient way to search a database, so I cobbled together this tool.
