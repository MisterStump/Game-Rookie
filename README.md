# Overview
Game Rookie is a GM/DM assisting tool for a popular Tabletop RPG.

The main issue I was experiencing as a GM was that I wanted to do basically 0 prep work, but still be able to pull together interesting encounters quickly. I basically needed a convenient way to search a database, so I cobbled together this tool.
